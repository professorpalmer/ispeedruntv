An entire full stack video-livestreaming platform built by me. Utilizes Node.js, Express, AWS, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and more.

This is a proof of concept portfolio project that I am now making available.

Features include :
- Automatically adjusted displays for tablet, PC, or mobile viewing.
- Fully integrated Discord chat | Handle emotes/moderation client side
- User account creation and database management.
- Up to 4k video
- Down to 1.5s latency
- Carousel display of featured videos
- Uncapped viewers
- Injectable video ads for your events, sponsors, etc
- Automatically stream up to 10 multi stream destinations when clicking 'Live' (Youtube, FB, Twitch, Kick, etc simultaneously)
- A contact page with working email form compatible with any email provider.
- Blog section

Utilizing Castr for video data, I managed to create a VERY cheap self-run video-livestreaming platform.
You can run this entire platform for about $350/annually. This includes the entire construction from video data to domain name.
